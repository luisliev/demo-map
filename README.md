Demo app for MAP_CLICK event issue

Issue:

Current behavior:
In a simple map (like the one in the official documents), when trying to add a marker with the latitude and longitude from a MAP_CLICK event data, I receive the info from the click but can't add a marker afterwards with those lat and lng variables.

Expected behavior:
Click the map in any place and a marker should be added wherever you clicked.
